==================================
How to be a self-aware advertisee.
==================================

Web advertising is big business;
it's where Google gets most of its money.

.. TODO: cite

Many high-traffic websites sell ads,
claiming their analytics know what users will care about,
thereby netting more customers for the advertisee.

The trouble is that websites don't track their users in aggregate,
they track users indvidually.
In fact, it's nearly impossible to stop websites from doing this.

There is absolutely nothing consumers can do to stop this.

But there is something they can do:
just tell the websites what ads they want to see.
It's useful information for the websites,
and it (indirectly) lets consumers support the things they like.

Should there be a category for ads you don't want to see,
or would that encourage griefing?

Griefers gonna grief.
Don't visit those websites.

    In my view, much of this problem is the result of tools that, by default, give
    up private data to third parties. For more than a decade, it's been normal for
    browser makers to take extraordinary steps to block pop-up ads out of the box;
    no similar effort is made to block third-party cookies, evercookies, browser
    profiling, etc.

    What we have today isn't a privacy marketplace, it's a privacy all-you-can-eat
    buffet. The "sellers" grab any and all private info they want from users, and
    the users' only remedy for this is to walk away, and even then, it's nearly
    impossible to figure out if you're still doing business...

Q. Is this a joke?

A. About 50/50.
I don't expect anyone to actually use it;
currently the only way to change the preferences data is to edit the userscript by hand.
I was just curious how hard it was to do.
(Not very hard, it turns out.)
